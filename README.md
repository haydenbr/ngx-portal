# NgxPortal

Sometimes, you might want one component to be able to send content to another component, but keep these components ignorant of each other. One example of this is if you have a global toolbar where other parts of the app should be able to control some content there.

React also has this concept baked in. ([React Portals](https://reactjs.org/docs/portals.html))
